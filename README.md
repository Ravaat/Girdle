# Girdle
This R pipeline and associated files were written by Marco Camaiti (and coauthors). It is meant to extract shape information from landmark coordinates of lizard (skink) girdles. 
The specific usage of the associated files is included and explained in the pipeline itself. 
The treefile for the phylogenetic tree used for these analyses can be accessed at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1055790315003127?via%3Dihub.
